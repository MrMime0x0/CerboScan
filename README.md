# CerboScan
This is a greyhack network scanner for local networks in greyhack.

# Description
<br>CerboScan is a network scanner for greyhack that lists out firewalls and servers on the network and shows their lan ip's on the network.</br>
<br>PS: This only can scan devices connected to a router and not devices connected to a Switch as it will error out.</br>
